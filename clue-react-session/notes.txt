React is not a framework.

Creates a ciew libray, so not lightweight at all

Importance of state management

Patterns, patterns, patterns
    - MVC aka "Model View Controller" (Bi-directional)
        - M -> The model of the data
        - V -> What you see
        - C -> interacts and modifies what is in V
        - V & C are bi-directional

    - Flux (Uni-Directional)

Flux Pattern
    - React, Flux -> State management library
    - Redux is a an implementation similar to Flux
    - Single storage

Immutability and Functional Programming
    - Never recycle a component
    - Same input gives same output
    - All dta flows down
    - Ex: Memory Game, hard to keep all tiles known if flipped
        - Using a global store, you are able to make all the tiles look into a single location to check for 
          differences in the data (like a boolean saying its already flipped)
        - Cannot be a different value

Hierarchy of Building a React App
1. Break the UI into diffierence component hierarchy (Think HTML and how its broken into parts)
2. Build a static version of the UI in React
3. Identify the minimal represntation of UI (the state object), figure out what is needed within the state
4. Identify where the state should live
5. Add inverse data flow

App tier is the only thing that can change the state as all data is sent to it in a uni-directional.


AirBnB Example

APP -> Nav
    -> Footer
    -> Content -> Home
               -> Experience
               -> Restaurant
Goal: Consolidate the services to themselves and make it extremely modular. UI should not be entangled together.

*** Start at the bottom of the hierarchy and imagine what components will you be using a lot of ***

Instagram Example
Look into the HTML and see how the sections divide in to (It should be very compartmentalized)

Nav
    -> Logo Home

    -> Search Bar

    -> Buttons
        -> Get the App
        -> Sign Up / Log In

Content
    -> Header
        -> Text Stuff
            -> Title
            -> Text Item
        -> Button to Follow

    -> Gallery
        -> Card
            -> Url for Picture
            -> Number of Likes
            -> Comments

Footer
    -> Menu
    -> Trademark
